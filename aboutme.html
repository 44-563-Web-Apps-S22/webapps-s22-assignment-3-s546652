I like spending time listening to songs, playing games. 
I am a huge fan of BTS, Kpop band and really enjoy listening their songs and programs related to them.

<h2>To All the Boys I've Loved Before</h2>
<p>
    Its is a novel written by a Korean author and as I am fasicated by korean flims and dram I thought of watching it.
    It's a lite romance comedy and majorly a school drama because of which I liked it a lot.I loved the the sister's bonding very much.
